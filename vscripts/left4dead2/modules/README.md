# L4D2 VScript Modules
Meant to make various L4D2 VScripting aspects easier; May not work with pure Squirrel... but why are you using Squirrel outside of Source 1 VScripting...?
It may be possible to port some of them outside of Squirrel, although its unlikely you'll need them outside of VScripting.


also dont judge the name of the scripts its just fun to name them like this :(
